<Turn up the Temperature>
1.
Write a function called f_to_c that takes an input f_temp, a temperature in Fahrenheit, and converts it to c_temp, that temperature in Celsius.
It should then return c_temp.
The equation you should use is:
Temp (C) = (Temp (F) - 32) * 5/9
>>>
def f_to_c(f_temp):
  c_temp = (f_temp-32)*5/9
  return c_temp

2.
Let’s test your function with a value of 100 Fahrenheit.
Define a variable f100_in_celsius and set it equal to the value of f_to_c with 100 as an input.
>>>
f100_in_celsius=f_to_c(100)

3.
Write a function called c_to_f that takes an input c_temp, a temperature in Celsius, and converts it to f_temp, that temperature in Fahrenheit.
It should then return f_temp.
The equation you should use is:
Temp (F) = Temp (C) * (9/5) + 32
>>>
def c_to_f(c_temp):
  f_temp = c_temp*9/5+32
  return f_temp
  

4.
Let’s test your function with a value of 0 Celsius.
Define a variable c0_in_fahrenheit and set it equal to the value of c_to_f with 0 as an input.
>>>
c0_in_fahrenheit = c_to_f(0)

5.
Define a function called get_force that takes in mass and acceleration. It should return mass multiplied by acceleration.
>>>
def get_force(mass, acceleration):
  mass = mass*acceleration
  return mass

6.
Test get_force by calling it with the variables train_mass and train_acceleration.
Save the result to a variable called train_force and print it out.
>>>
train_force = get_force(train_mass, train_acceleration)
print(train_force)

7.
Print the string “The GE train supplies X Newtons of force.”, with X replaced by train_force.
>>>
print("The GE train supplies "+str(train_force)+" Newtons of force")

8.
Define a function called get_energy that takes in mass and c.
c is a constant that is usually set to the speed of light, which is roughly 3 x 10^8. Set c to have a default value of 3*10**8.
get_energy should return mass multiplied by c squared.
>>>
def get_energy(mass,c):
  c= 3*10^8
  mass = mass*c
  return mass

9.
Test get_energy by using it on bomb_mass, with the default value of c. Save the result to a variable called bomb_energy.
>>>
bomb_energy=get_energy(bomb_mass)
print(bomb_energy)

10.
Print the string “A 1kg bomb supplies X Joules.”, with X replaced by bomb_energy.
>>>
print("A 1kg bomb supplies " + str(bomb_energy) +" Joules.")

11.
Define a final function called get_work that takes in mass, acceleration, and distance.
Work is defined as force multiplied by distance. First, get the force using get_force, then multiply that by distance. Return the result.
>>>
def get_work(mass,accelration,distance):
  force=get_force(mass,acceleration)
  work=force*distance
  return work

12.
Test get_work by using it on train_mass, train_acceleration, and train_distance. Save the result to a variable called train_work.
>>>
train_work=get_work(train_mass, train_acceleration, train_distance)
print(train_work)

13.
Print the string "The GE train does X Joules of work over Y meters.", with X replaced with train_work and Y replaced with train_distance.
>>>
print("The GE train does "+str(train_work)+ " Joules of work over " +str(train_distance)+" meters.")
